## Description

I am on my computer all the time. This has had a really bad impact on my eyes and my back. I often used to forget to drink water or take a break. That also meant I used to keep siting for a long time.

That is why I created this Chrome Extension. With the help of this extension, I am reminded to take a break, stand, and look away from the screen every 20 minutes. I choose 20 minutes because that is what Healthline suggests in their "[How Does the 20-20-20 Rule Prevent Eye Strain?](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#:~:text=What's%20the%2020%2D20%2D20,a%20total%20of%2020%20seconds.)" article.

This Chrome extension can help you not only prevent eye strain but also help you stay hydrated and stand for a bit every 20 minutes. You can, of course, easily tweak the interval as you please with basic customization.

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).
